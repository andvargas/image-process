# Image processing app

I've done this project as a technical assessment for a job interview, during which, I was unable to complete it, so I took some time to understand and completed the task at home at my own pace.

## 1.0.1

- Iterates over a folder of files
- Checks the filesize of each image, if > 6Mb, reduce the size to max 2500 px and try again
- Checks the newly created file - if still > 6Mb, reduce to 2000 px and try again
- Files are saved in a new folder
